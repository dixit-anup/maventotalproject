What is MongoTemplate?

    The template offers convenience methods and automatic mapping
    between MongoDB JSON documents and your domain classes. Out of
    the box, MongoTemplate uses a Java-based default converter but
    you can also write your own converter classes to be used for
    reading and storing domain objects.
