Spring Security is a customizable authentication and access service
framework for server side Java-based enterprise software applications.
two major areas of application security are “authentication” and
“authorization” (or “access-control”). These are the two main areas
that Spring Security targets.

1. “Authentication” is the process of establishing a principal
is who they claim to be (a “principal” generally means a user,
device or some other system which can perform an action in your
application).

2. “Authorization” refers to the process of deciding whether a principal
is allowed to perform an action within your application.

There are three main areas of interest in respect of authorization,
these being authorizing web requests, authorizing whether methods
can be invoked, and authorizing access to individual domain object
instances.


Following are the some of the important facilities that Spring Security
Framework provides to it’s users:

    User authentication and authorization.
    Role based authorization control.
    Easy to configure with database based authentication and authorization.
    Encrypted password.
    Form authentication.
    File bases user authentication and authorization.

Spring security take care about all incoming HTTP requests via servlet
filters, and implements "user defined" security checking
