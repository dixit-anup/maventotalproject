http  - it's a protocol to communicate between client (browser) and server (container of servlets - tomcat...)
It is used for dynamic requests. Http transactions are either request or a response.
Transaction consists of 3 parts:
- a single request or response line.
request line consists of http method (usually GET or POST) followed by document address and the
HTTP version number being used. GET /contents.html HTTP/1.1 uses HTTP GET method to request the
document contents.html using HTTP version 1.1.. The response line contains HTTP status code that
indicates whether the request was successful (understood and satisfied) or if not, why not.
-  the HTTP headers - this is a set of fields used to exchange information between the client and the server.
For example, the following tells the server that the client will accept the ISO8859.5 and unicode 1.1
character sets:
Accept-Charset: iso-8859-5, unicode-1-1

The client uses the headers to tell the server about it's configuration and the document type
will accept. The server, in turn, uses the header to return information about the requested
document, such as it's age and location.

- the HTTP body. It is optionally used by the client to sent any additional information (see POST method).
The server uses the body to return the requested document.

HTTP URL - universal resource locator URL (also known as URI) - are used on the WEB to identify
documents, images, downloadable files, services, electronic mailboxes and other resources.
It contains of protocol name (http://), host (ip address or domain name to access to), port -
(socket or service number) - to connect on the host. Default is 80 (the TCP/IP port), path -
is the path to the document  on the host.
