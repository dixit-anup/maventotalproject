Having multiple servers help each other in this way is typically called "redundancy".
When an error happens and the tasks is moved from the failing server to a functioning server,
this is typically called "failover".
A set of servers running the same application in cooperation is typically referred to
as a "cluster" of servers. The purpose of a cluster is typically both of the above two
mentioned goals: To distribute load onto different servers, and to provide redundancy / failover
for each other.

Common Load Balancing Schemes

The most common load balancing schemes are:

    Even Task Distribution Scheme

    The requests will be devided evenly but the difference between tasks will not be taken into
    account. So one server could be overloaded... (Round robin)

    DNS Based load balancing.

    Cluster distributes the requests to different servers and assign ports for clients. But some computers
    cash dns, so clients may use the same server as previously, regardless of load of server.


    Weighted Task Distribution Scheme

    The tasks will be distributed according to ratio (weight). This is helpful if capacity of servers varies.


    Sticky Session Scheme

    Session shared between servers.

    Even Size Task Queue Distribution Scheme

    Cluster uses queues here.

    Autonomous Queue Scheme
