The main principles of object-orienting programming:

1. Inheritance
2. Incapsulation
3. Polymorphysm

Also we abstraction

One interface - many implementations. In java polimorthism includes
overriding, overloading. You should always use type of parent class in parameters
of method, return type of method, in object creation.
Also we may see polimorthism in generics. We may pass any subclass of generic type.
