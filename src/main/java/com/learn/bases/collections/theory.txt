Iterator fail-safe property work with the clone of underlying collection, hence itâ€™s not affected by any modification
in the collection. By design, all the collection classes in java.util package are fail-fast whereas collection classes
in java.util.concurrent are fail-safe. Fail-fast iterators throw ConcurrentModificationException whereas fail-safe
iterator never throws ConcurrentModificationException. Check this post for CopyOnWriteArrayList Example.
