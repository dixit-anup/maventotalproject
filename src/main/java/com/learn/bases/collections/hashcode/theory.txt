    If o1.equals(o2), then o1.hashCode() == o2.hashCode()should always be true.
    If o1.hashCode() == o2.hashCode is true, it doesnâ€™t mean that o1.equals(o2) will be true.

    If the class overrides equals() method, it should also override hashCode() method.
    The class should follow the rules associated with equals() and hashCode() for all instances. Please refer earlier
    question for these rules.
    If a class field is not used in equals(), you should not use it in hashCode() method.
    Best practice for user defined key class is to make it immutable, so that hashCode() value can be cached for fast
    performance. Also immutable classes make sure that hashCode() and equals() will not change in future that will
    solve any issue with mutability.
