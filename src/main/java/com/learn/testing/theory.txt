there are only 3 things you really need to worry about; stubbing, setting expectations and verifying.
Some unit test scenarios donâ€™t involve any of these, others involve only stubbing and others
involve setting expectations and verifying.

Stubbing.
Stubbing is the process of telling your fake how to behave when it is interacted with.
You can generally stub public properties (those with getters and/or setters) and public
functions.

Setting expectations
One of the key features of a fake is the ability to tell the fake what you expect
when your test runs. For example, you may expect that a specific function be
invoked exactly 3 times.

Verifying
Setting expectations and verification go hand in hand. Setting expectations is done
prior to invoking the function(s) on the class under test. Verification is done after.

Mockito attempts to eliminate the expect-run-verify pattern[6] by removing the
specification of expectations, the coupling is reduced or minimized

in MockitoTrainings class you can see examples...
